# TA-X

This repository is a compendium of every public Task-Awareness library that has been developed by the STAR group at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center.

Task-Aware libraries work both with the [OmpSs-2 Programming Model](https://github.com/bsc-pm/ompss-2-releases) and OpenMP through our implementation of the [OpenMP LLVM Library](https://github.com/bsc-pm/llvm).

The currently available TA-X libraries are:

 * [Task-Aware MPI](https://github.com/bsc-pm/tampi): Library providing support for taskifying MPI communications
 * [Task-Aware GASPI](https://github.com/bsc-pm/tagaspi): Library providing support for taskifying RMA communications
 * [Task-Aware CUDA](https://github.com/bsc-pm/tacuda): Library providing support for taskifying CUDA kernels and operations
 * [Task-Aware HIP](https://github.com/bsc-pm/tahip): Library providing support for taskifying HIP kernels and operations
 * [Task-Aware SYCL](https://github.com/bsc-pm/tasycl): Library providing support for taskifying SYCL kernels and operations
 * [Task-Aware AscendCL](https://github.com/bsc-pm/tacl): Library providing support for taskifying AscendCL kernels and operations
